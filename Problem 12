Question:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.



Solution:

import re

inputted=input("Enter your sentence to calculate the number upper and lowercase letters: ")

uppercase=re.findall(r'[A-Z]',inputted)
lowercase=re.findall(r'[a-z]',inputted)

print(f'There are {len(uppercase)} uppercase letters and {len(lowercase)} lowercase letters in your sentence.')
