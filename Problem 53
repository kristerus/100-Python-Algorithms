Question:

Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" format, please write program to print the company name of a given email address. Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.

Example:
If the following email address is given as input to the program:

john@google.com

Then, the output of the program should be:

google

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Hints:

Use \w to match letters.

Solution:

import re

inputted=input("Enter your email address: ")
regex="(\w+)@(\w+)\.(\w+)"
result=re.match(regex,inputted)
print(result.group(2))

### The approach with nested lists could be used as well.
