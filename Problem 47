Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width. The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area. 

Hints:

Use def methodName(self) to define a method.

Solution:

class Rectangle(object):
  def __init__(self,width,length):
    self.width=width
    self.length=length

  def area(self):
    return self.width*self.length

one=Rectangle(2,3)
print(one.area())
