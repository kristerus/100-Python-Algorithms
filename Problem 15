Question:
Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Then, the output should be:
1,3,5,7,9

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:


inputted=input("Enter the list of values comma seperated: ")
values=inputted.split(",")
values=[int(i) for i in values]
for i in range(len(values)):
  if i%2!=0:
    values.pop(i)
  str(i)
print(values)
