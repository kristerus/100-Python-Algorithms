Question:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10
DIGITS 3

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.



Solution:

import re

inputted=input("Enter your sentence to calculate the number of digits and letters: ")

letters=re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z]',inputted)
digits=re.findall(r'[0-9]',inputted)

print(f'There are {len(letters)} letters and {len(digits)} digits in your sentence.')
